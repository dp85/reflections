When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  There are several reasons to use a remote repository. First, you are backing-up your data and are covered in the
  event that your disk fails. Secondly, it allows you to work on the same repository on multiple machines. Also,
  it allows for easy collaboration between multiple people working on the same project.
